# MacOS Microphone Permission

MacOS requires any application that wants to use the microphone to show a permission dialog.

Since Minecraft itself doesn't need the microphone, we are not able to request access for it.
However, some launchers add the ability to ask for microphone permission.

## Supported Launchers

- [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) <Badge type="tip" text="Recommended" />
- [GDLauncher](hhttps://gdlauncher.com/)


::: warning NOTE
If you have issues **installing** or **setting up** any of these launchers, visit the [Prism Launcher Discord server](https://discord.gg/prismlauncher) or the [GDLauncher Discord server](https://discord.gdlauncher.com/) respectively for help.

Please don't ask them for help with the voice chat mod itself!

## Alternatives

### CurseForge Launcher

In order to get micrphone permissions on the CurseForge Launcher, you need to do the following steps:

- Open the **CurseForge Launcher**
- Go to **Settings**
- Go to **Game Specific** -> **Minecraft**
- Scroll down to **Launcher Settings**
- Select **Skip launcher with CurseForge**

This skips opening the vanilla launcher when launching the game, which will allow the voice chat to ask for microphone permissions.
