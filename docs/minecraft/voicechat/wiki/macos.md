# MacOS Microphone Permission

MacOS requires any application that wants to use the microphone to show a permission dialog.

Since Minecraft itself doesn't need the microphone, we are not able to request access for it.
However, some launchers add the ability to ask for microphone permission.

In order to use the voice chat on MacOS, you need to use [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/).

::: warning NOTE
If you have issues **installing** or **setting up** the launcher, visit the [Prism Launcher Discord server](https://discord.gg/prismlauncher) for help.

Please don't ask them for help with the voice chat mod itself!

## Alternatives

**CurseForge Launcher**

In order to get micrphone permissions on the CurseForge Launcher, you need to do the following steps:

- Open the **CurseForge Launcher**
- Go to **Settings**
- Go to **Game Specific** -> **Minecraft**
- Scroll down to **Launcher Settings**
- Select **Skip launcher with CurseForge**

This skips opening the vanilla launcher when launching the game, which will allow the voice chat to ask for microphone permissions.
