# Submitting a Server Hosting Guide

If you want to submit a guide on how to set up Simple Voice Chat for a specific hoster,
please first make sure that there isn't already a guide [here](server_setup_mc_hosting).

You can submit the guide in the [Simple Voice Chat Discord](https://discord.gg/4dH2zwTmyX) in the `#server-hosting-submissions` channel.
We also appreciate updates to existing guides.

::: warning NOTE
Please make sure that your guide is as detailed as possible and easy to understand.

Please only submit guides for specific Minecraft hosters and not for general server hosters.
