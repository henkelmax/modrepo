# Debugging

::: warning NOTE
Do not enable debug logging if you are not experiencing issues.
This option is meant to help with debugging issues with the mod/plugin and might lead to slightly decreased performance.
:::

You can enable debug logging of the mod/plugin by setting the Java system property `voicechat.debug` (`-Dvoicechat.debug=true` in the Java parameters).
