# JavaDocs For Older Versions

You can access the JavaDocs for older versions of the API by replacing the version in the URL with the version you want to access:

Replace `<API-VERSION>` in `https://maven.maxhenkel.de/javadoc/releases/de/maxhenkel/voicechat/voicechat-api/<API-VERSION>` with the voice chat API version.

Example for version `2.1.12`:
[https://maven.maxhenkel.de/javadoc/releases/de/maxhenkel/voicechat/voicechat-api/2.1.12](https://maven.maxhenkel.de/javadoc/releases/de/maxhenkel/voicechat/voicechat-api/2.1.12)
