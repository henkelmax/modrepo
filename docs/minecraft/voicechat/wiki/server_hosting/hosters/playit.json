        "Create a new UDP tunnel. The address should look something like this: <code>adjective-noun.auto.playit.gg:59931</code>",
        "Set the <code>port</code> property in the <code>voicechat-server.properties</code> file to the port of your UDP tunnel, in this case <code>59931</code>",
        "Change the <code>voice_host</code> property in the voice chat config file to your UDP tunnel address without the port included, in this case <code>voice_host=adjective-noun.auto.playit.gg</code>",
        "This is only for the voice chat. When you join a server with your local ip or TCP playit tunnel, voice chat will tell your mod to connect the voice chat over a separate UDP tunnel that you enter in voice_host. You're going to be using two separate tunnels at once"
