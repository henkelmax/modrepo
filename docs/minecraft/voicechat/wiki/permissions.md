# Permissions

Simple Voice Chat has permissions for the
[Bukkit permission system](https://bukkit.fandom.com/wiki/Understanding_Permissions),

the NeoForge permission API and the [Fabric Permissions API](https://github.com/lucko/fabric-permissions-api).

::: danger NOTE
We don't support **hybrid servers**! Please either use only plugins or only mods on your server.

If you for some reason don't have permission for something that is granted to everyone by default, you might have misconfigured your permissions manager or are using a hybrid server.
